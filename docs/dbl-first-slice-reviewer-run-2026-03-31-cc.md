## Part 3 - Reviewer answers

### Q1. What does the current first-slice DBL gate appear able to judge?

Whether explicit precondition signals are **absent** from the task context.

Specifically, the gate responds to three named signals declared in a consuming
contract:

- `preconditions_missing_sample`
- `preconditions_missing_spec`
- `preconditions_missing_fixture`

When a task type matches one of these declared categories and no explicit signal
of the required prerequisite appears in the task text, the gate changes the
pre-task verdict deterministically:

- `L0` -> `analysis_only`
- `L1` -> `restrict_code_generation_and_escalate`
- `L2` -> `stop`

The gate is binary on presence: the signal is either explicitly there or
explicitly not there.

### Q2. What does the current first-slice DBL gate appear unable to judge?

Whether a present signal represents adequate, relevant, or trustworthy
evidence.

Specifically:

- It cannot tell whether `legacy-spec.md` is the right spec for the task
- It cannot tell whether `happy-path-report.pdf` covers relevant edge cases
- It cannot tell whether a named spec is complete, current, or applicable
- It does not distinguish pseudo-presence (a file name that pattern-matches the
  signal category) from genuine coverage

The gate is satisfied by any text that contains an explicit mention of the
required artifact type. It does not evaluate what that artifact says or whether
it is sufficient.

### Q3. In what situation would the current gate still pass even though the evidence may be semantically weak or incomplete?

Any task text that includes an explicit signal-like reference will satisfy the
current gate, regardless of evidence quality.

Two concrete examples from the materials:

- `Implement protocol handling for firmware packets using legacy-spec.md` passes
  because `legacy-spec.md` contains an explicit spec-like signal. The gate does
  not check whether that spec covers the actual protocol.

- `Implement a PDF parser using sample file happy-path-report.pdf` passes
  because `happy-path-report.pdf` contains an explicit sample-like signal. The
  gate does not check whether the sample covers parser edge cases.

The general pattern: a short, wrong-version, irrelevant, or incomplete artifact
named in the task text satisfies the first slice just as well as a complete
one.

### Q4. Is the insufficiency-like example a capability proof or a limitation proof? Why?

It is a **limitation proof**.

The example deliberately shows inputs that satisfy the current gate's
explicit-presence check while remaining semantically weak. A passing result in
this example does not mean the framework detected that the evidence was
adequate. It means the framework found an explicit signal and stopped there.

The materials say this directly in two places:

- `examples/README.md`: "A passing result there means only that the current
  first slice detected explicit precondition presence. It does not mean the
  framework already performs semantic adequacy or evidence-quality judgment."

- `insufficiency-like-preconditions/README.md`: "This example should therefore
  be used as: a reconstruction example / a reviewer expectation-setting example
  / a precursor to future adversarial / insufficiency validation. Not as proof
  that the framework already validates evidence quality."

Treating a pass here as a capability claim would be a failed reconstruction.

## Part 4 - Misread log

### 4.1 First over-inference point

```
File or sentence I was reading:
  minimal-preconditions/README.md:
  "reviewer-visible trace can show which precondition changed the result"

What I thought the framework was claiming at that point:
  That the trace records evaluation depth - i.e., the runtime assessed the
  precondition and determined it was insufficient, then logged why.

What made me think that:
  "Changed the result" is ambiguous: it could mean "the absence of precondition
  X triggered a stricter verdict" (presence/absence binary) or "the runtime
  evaluated precondition X and found it wanting" (quality judgment). The word
  "changed" implies a before/after comparison that could point to either
  interpretation.
```

### 4.2 First hesitation point

```
Where I slowed down or became unsure:
  examples/README.md table row:
  "Shows what the current first slice does not yet distinguish about weak or
  irrelevant evidence"

What I was unsure about:
  Whether "does not yet distinguish" means the runtime sees the weak evidence,
  attempts to distinguish it, but fails - or whether it never attempts the
  distinction at all and simply matches on explicit signal presence.

What I expected the file to clarify but it did not:
  The README table description implies a detection attempt that falls short.
  The insufficiency-like README corrects this: there is no detection attempt
  for quality; the gate only checks presence. This correction arrived one file
  later, not in the same sentence.
```

### 4.3 Final classification

```
Did the examples let me distinguish explicit presence from semantic sufficiency?
Partial

  The distinction is correct and fully stated by the end of the material set.
  However, the first over-inference point (minimal-preconditions "changed the
  result") and the first hesitation point (README table "does not yet
  distinguish") both suggest the framing creates small openings for a reviewer
  to initially over-read the gate's capability before the corrective language
  lands.

Did I interpret the insufficiency-like example as a limitation proof?
Y

  Both README.md and the insufficiency-like README are unambiguous on this.

Did any green test / passing result make me think the framework already checks
adequacy?
N

  The framing is strong enough to prevent this. The WARNING-level framing
  note in insufficiency-like README.md ("must not be interpreted as semantic
  adequacy detection") closes this before the passing result can be misread.

If yes, where did that impression come from?
N/A
```

## Reconstruction result

- Status: `reconstructed correctly`

The four questions were answered in alignment with Part 6 of the test pack:

- current slice is explicit-precondition / missingness oriented: **confirmed**
- semantic sufficiency is still out of scope: **confirmed**
- insufficiency-like example is a limitation proof: **confirmed**

---

## Misread source

Two framing openings were identified that did not block correct reconstruction
but created momentary ambiguity before corrective language appeared:

1. `minimal-preconditions/README.md` - "reviewer-visible trace can show which
   precondition changed the result" implies evaluation depth; should say
   "which precondition absence changed the result" to close the ambiguity at
   point-of-read.

2. `examples/README.md` table - "Shows what the current first slice does not
   yet distinguish about weak or irrelevant evidence" implies an attempted
   distinction that falls short. Should say "shows that the current first slice
   does not attempt to distinguish" to prevent the detection-attempt reading.

Neither caused a failed reconstruction. Both are framing risks for faster or
less careful reads.

## Follow-up judgment

- Fix type: `framing-only`
- Notes:
  - No runtime gap. The gate works as described.
  - No docs-structure issue. The three files are logically ordered.
  - Two specific phrases should be tightened to remove the momentary
    over-inference openings noted above. Both are single-sentence edits.
  - The corrective language in `examples/README.md` (Important DBL framing
    section) and in `insufficiency-like-preconditions/README.md` (opening
    callout box) is strong and did its job. The two framing tightening
    suggestions are incremental, not blocking.
