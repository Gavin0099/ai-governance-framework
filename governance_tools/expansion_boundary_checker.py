"""
expansion_boundary_checker.py

Passive audit tool. Detects signs that the runtime boundary has been crossed
without going through the Expansion Admission Gate.

This is NOT a runtime hook. It does not run during sessions. It does not
affect ok, task_level, risk, or oversight. It is a standalone CLI tool.

Run it as part of CI or manually:
    python -m governance_tools.expansion_boundary_checker

Returns exit code 0 if no violations found, 1 if violations found.
