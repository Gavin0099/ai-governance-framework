E1b Phase 2 — Distribution Analysis Script.

Reads one or more canonical-audit-log.jsonl files, computes per-repo
entropy / signal_ratio / degenerate metrics, and evaluates whether the
accumulated observation pool satisfies the Phase 2 readiness gate.

Purpose
-------
Make Phase 2 "observably waiting" rather than "passively waiting".
Running this script after real sessions accumulate answers:

  - Is the log growing into a usable distribution?
  - Are there low-entropy / degenerate repos dominating the pool?
  - Does the pool have enough repo diversity to build a valid baseline?

Phase 2 readiness gate (all four conditions must pass before Phase 3):
  --min-sessions N          total session entries across all repos
  --min-repos   M           distinct contributing repos
  --min-nondegenerate R     fraction of repos that are NOT degenerate
  --max-dominance R         max fraction any one repo can occupy

Usage
-----
    # Default: read this repo's own log
    python scripts/analyze_e1b_distribution.py

    # Read multiple repo logs (merged view)
    python scripts/analyze_e1b_distribution.py --log-path a.jsonl b.jsonl c.jsonl

    # Override gate thresholds
    python scripts/analyze_e1b_distribution.py --min-sessions 40 --min-repos 5

    # Machine-readable output
    python scripts/analyze_e1b_distribution.py --json

E1b Phase roadmap
-----------------
  Phase 1 (done):     passive observation — entropy + degenerate guard; advisory_only=True
  Phase 2 (this):     distribution understanding — accumulate + analyze real sessions
  Phase 3 (blocked):  trigger design — only after Phase 2 gate passes
