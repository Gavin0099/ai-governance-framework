# CodeBurn Phase 2 Report Token Provenance Slice Spec (2026-05-05)

## Problem
The current highest-risk gap is not missing token math. It is human misinterpretation on the report surface.

`codeburn_report.py` currently exposes `token_observability_level` to reviewer-facing output, but it does not yet disclose provenance on that same surface.

This creates a specific semantic risk:

- reviewers may read `step_level` as high-trust or provider-only telemetry
- current runtime/report output does not yet expose `token_source_summary`
- current runtime/report output does not yet expose `provenance_warning`

As a result, the report surface can over-signal fidelity even when provenance is mixed or incomplete.

## Target Outcome
Land the smallest runtime slice that reduces human-facing provenance misinterpretation on the report surface without expanding decision authority.

This slice is successful when `codeburn_report.py` can disclose mixed provenance directly in reviewer-facing output while preserving the current advisory-only boundary.

## Scope
In scope:

- `codeburn/phase1/codeburn_report.py` only
- report JSON output
- report text output
- report-only provenance disclosure for token telemetry
- report tests needed to prove the new disclosure is present and decision posture is unchanged

## Non-goals
Out of scope:

- `codeburn_analyze.py`
- gate logic or gate policy changes
- schema migration
- decision authority changes
- `comparability_token` redesign
- provider coverage ratio
- new authority-granting machine interpretation

## Affected Surfaces
Primary implementation surface:

- `codeburn/phase1/codeburn_report.py`

Likely adjacent validation surfaces:

- `tests/test_codeburn_phase1_report.py`
- `codeburn/phase1/DATA_VALIDITY_CONTRACT.md` only if the runtime-valid report contract requires a narrow wording update
- `codeburn/phase1/TOKEN_TELEMETRY_CONTRACT_V0_1.md` only if the implemented field names must be reconciled with the current design contract language

## Boundary And API Considerations
Current local report truth:

- `build_report()` emits `token_observability_level`
- `build_report()` emits `decision_usage_allowed = False`
- `_print_text()` renders `Token observability level: ...`
- no provenance disclosure is currently emitted on either JSON or text surface

This slice must preserve the existing Phase 1/2 authority boundary:

- `decision_usage_allowed` remains `false`
- `analysis_safe_for_decision` remains `false`
- provenance disclosure increases truthfulness only; it does not increase machine authority

Proposed minimum runtime fields for the report surface:

- `token_source_summary`
- `provenance_warning`

Proposed minimum interpretation rule:

- if report surface shows `token_observability_level = step_level` and provenance is mixed, the same report surface must also show `token_source_summary = mixed(...)`
- mixed-source `step_level` must also show `provenance_warning = mixed_sources`
- absence of `provenance_warning` must not be reinterpreted as provider-only authority

## Failure Paths And Risk Points
Primary risk points for this slice:

- JSON output adds provenance fields but text output does not, leaving reviewer-facing ambiguity intact
- text output adds a generic warning but omits `token_source_summary`, forcing reviewers to infer provenance
- mixed-source report output is present but changes are mirrored into `analyze`, accidentally expanding machine interpretation scope
- implementation treats absence of provider data as authority downgrade logic instead of disclosure logic

Specific failure conditions for review:

- report can still display `step_level` without any provenance disclosure on a mixed-source session
- `decision_usage_allowed` changes from `false`
- new fields imply provider-only trust when provenance is mixed

## Evidence Plan
Minimum validation evidence for this slice:

- narrow report tests proving mixed-source step-level output includes `token_source_summary`
- narrow report tests proving mixed-source step-level output includes `provenance_warning = mixed_sources`
- narrow report tests proving `decision_usage_allowed` stays `false`
- narrow text-surface test proving reviewer-facing output shows the same provenance disclosure, not JSON-only disclosure

Suggested executable validation target:

- `pytest tests/test_codeburn_phase1_report.py`

If text rendering and JSON rendering are split in tests, both surfaces must be covered explicitly.

## Acceptance Criteria
This slice is complete only if all of the following are true:

1. Mixed + step-level report output displays `token_source_summary = mixed(...)`.
2. Mixed + step-level report output displays `provenance_warning = mixed_sources`.
3. `decision_usage_allowed` remains `false`.
4. Absence of `provenance_warning` is not treated as provider-only by the implemented report logic or reviewer-facing output.

## Implementation Tranche Recommendation
Recommended first tranche:

1. Add the smallest provenance summarization helper needed by `codeburn_report.py`.
2. Emit `token_source_summary` and `provenance_warning` in report JSON.
3. Render the same provenance disclosure in report text.
4. Add narrow tests for mixed-source step-level disclosure and unchanged decision boundary.

Explicit defer:

- do not modify `codeburn_analyze.py` in the same slice
- do not add schema-level provenance ratio fields in the same slice
- do not combine this slice with gate, policy, or authority work

## Why Report First
`analyze` is primarily a machine-consumable interpretation surface.

`report` is the reviewer-facing surface where the current highest-value fix lives, because the main risk is human shortcut reading:

- `step_level -> must be high trust`

Therefore the first runtime slice should reduce reviewer misinterpretation before it expands machine-readable telemetry semantics elsewhere.
